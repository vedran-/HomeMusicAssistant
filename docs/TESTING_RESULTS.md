# Testing Results - Home Assistant Voice Control System

## Latest Fix (2025-05-24) - Play Music Enhancement âœ…

### Issue Fixed
The LLM was incorrectly rejecting music requests with specific artists/songs, responding with:
`LLM selected tool: unknown_request with parameters: {'reason': 'play_music tool does not support specifying artist/track names'}`

### Solution Implemented
1. **Updated Tool Description**: Enhanced `play_music` tool description in `src/llm/prompts.py` to clearly state it supports any music query
2. **Added Search Term Parameter**: Added `search_term` parameter to allow LLM to specify what music to play
3. **Updated Tool Registry**: Modified `src/tools/registry.py` to handle and pass search terms to AutoHotkey script

### Tool Updates
```json
{
  "name": "play_music",
  "description": "Play any music based on user request - supports artists, songs, genres, albums, movies, or any music-related query. Can also control playback (play, pause, toggle, next, previous).",
  "parameters": {
    "action": {"type": "string", "enum": ["play", "pause", "toggle", "next", "previous"]},
    "search_term": {"type": "string", "description": "What to play - artist name, song title, genre, album, or any music search term"}
  }
}
```

### Tested Commands âœ…
- "play Boards of Canada" â†’ âœ… SUCCESS: `play_music(action="play", search_term="Boards of Canada")`
- "play some jazz music" â†’ âœ… SUCCESS: `play_music(action="play", search_term="jazz")`
- "play Hamilton soundtrack" â†’ âœ… SUCCESS: `play_music(action="play", search_term="Hamilton soundtrack")`
- "play classic rock" â†’ âœ… SUCCESS: `play_music(action="play", search_term="classic rock")`
- "pause the music" â†’ âœ… SUCCESS: `play_music(action="pause")`

### System Integration âœ…
- AutoHotkey script receives search term correctly: `music_controller.ahk play "Boards of Canada"`
- YouTube Music integration working: Successfully searches and plays requested music
- User feedback improved: "Playing: Boards of Canada" instead of generic "Playing music"
